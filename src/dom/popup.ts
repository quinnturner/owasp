/**
 * Open a popup window with the given URL, name, and window features.
 *
 * @param url - The URL to open in the popup.
 * @param name - The name of the popup window.
 * @param windowFeatures - A string containing a comma-separated list of window features in the form `name=value` â€” or for boolean features, just name.
 * These features include options such as the window's default size and position, whether or not to open a minimal popup window, and so forth.
 * The following options are supported:
 * - `'popup'`: Requests a minimal popup window. If no other features are specified, the new browsing context will be a tab.
 * - `'width'`: Specifies the width of the content area, including scrollbars. The minimum required value is `100`.
 * - `'innerWidth'`: Specifies the width of the content area, excluding scrollbars. The minimum required value is `100`.
 * - `'height'`: Specifies the height of the content area, including scrollbars. The minimum required value is `100`.
 * - `'innerHeight'`: Specifies the height of the content area, excluding scrollbars. The minimum required value is `100`.
 * - `'left'`: Specifies the distance in pixels from the left side of the work area where the new window will be generated.
 * - `'screenX'`: Specifies the distance in pixels from the left side of the screen where the new window will be generated.
 * - `'top'`: Specifies the distance in pixels from the top side of the work area where the new window will be generated.
 * - `'screenY'`: Specifies the distance in pixels from the top side of the screen where the new window will be generated.
 * - `'noopener'`: Prevents the new window from having access to the originating window via `Window.opener`.
 * - `'noreferrer'`: Omits the `Referer` header and sets `noopener` to true.
 *
 * @returns If the browser successfully opens the new browsing context, a `WindowProxy` object is returned.
 *          The returned reference can be used to access properties and methods of the new context as long as it complies with the same-origin policy security requirements.
 *          `null` is returned if the browser fails to open the new browsing context, for example because it was blocked by a browser popup blocker.
